# RCES Project: Multidecadal East African Hydroclimate Variability
There is evidence that on multidecadal timescales, the hydroclimate of East Africa is driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole's (IOD) influence on the local Walker Circulation ([Tierney et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11785)). Further work has shown that volcanism can impact global hydroclimate by shifting the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) ([Tejedor et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019145118)). I intend to investigate the effects of volcanism on climate in East Africa through the lens of the 1883 eruption of Mt. Krakatoa. Using [CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/), I can investigate how models react to the Krakatoa eruption and then test how the eruption affects East African hydroclimate during different states of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and IOD.
