# RCES Project: East African Hydroclimate and Mt. Krakatoa
There is evidence that on multidecadal timescales, the hydroclimate of East Africa is driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole's (IOD) influence on the local Walker Circulation ([Tierney et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11785)). Further work has shown that volcanism can impact global hydroclimate by shifting the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) ([Tejedor et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019145118)). I intend to investigate the effects of volcanism on climate in East Africa through the lens of the 1883 eruption of Mt. Krakatoa. Using [PHYDA](https://zenodo.org/records/1198817) for historical PDSI and [CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/) for soil moisture, I can average PDSI, soil moisture, and other variables such as temperature in the 5 years prior to the eruption in multiple model ensembles. Then, I can subtract the 5-year average prior to the eruption to a timeseries that includes the eruption and investigate anomalies. Furthermore, I can average PDSI over East Africa over a 1000-year period in PHYDA to create PDSI significance bands, and compare the perturbation caused by the eruption to these bands. Lastly, I can use observational data from [HadiSST](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/data/download.html) to compare any anomalies I find to IOD and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices over the same period. Through these analyses, I can explore how hydroclimate reacted to the Krakatoa eruption. My analysis will include timeseries analysis of PDSI, soil moisture, and ENSO and IOD indices. I expect to see that a negative IOD aligns with drought in East Africa, and I expect that cooling from volcanism would enhance the negative IOD.
