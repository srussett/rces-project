# RCES Project: East African Hydroclimate and Mt. Krakatoa
There is evidence that that volcanism can cause statistically significant anomalies in global hydroclimate; [Tejedor et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019145118) found that large volcanic eruptions tended to produce dry conditions over tropical Africa. [Tejedor et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019145118) argues that this drying is caused by a string of teleconnections: increased cooling in the Northern Hemisphere causes the meridional temperature gradient to change and shifts the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to the south. This ITCZ shift causes drying in Africa by affecting the African monsoon. I intend to investigate the effects of volcanism on climate in East Africa through the lens of the 1883 eruption of Mt. Krakatoa. Using [PHYDA](https://zenodo.org/records/1198817) for historical PDSI and [CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/) for soil moisture, I can average PDSI, soil moisture, and temperature prior to the eruption in multiple model ensembles. Then, I can average PDSI over East Africa over a 1000-year period in PHYDA to create PDSI significance bands, and compare the perturbation caused by the eruption to these bands. Through these analyses, I can explore how hydroclimate reacted to the Krakatoa eruption. My analysis will include timeseries analysis of PDSI, soil moisture, and temperature. I expect to see that the eruption caused short-term negative perturbations in temperature, and longer-term decadal-scale negative impacts on PDSI.
