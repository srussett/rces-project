# RCES Project: Multidecadal East African Hydroclimate Variability
There is evidence that on multidecadal timescales, the hydroclimate of East Africa is driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole's (IOD) influence on the local Walker Circulation ([Tierney et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11785)). Further work has shown that volcanism can impact global hydroclimate by shifting the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) ([Tejedor et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019145118)). I intend to investigate the effects of volcanism on climate in East Africa through the lens of the 1883 eruption of Mt. Krakatoa. Using [PHYDA](https://zenodo.org/records/1198817) and [CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/), I can calculate the spectral coherence of the IOD index  with Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) data over historic timescales. By seeing how the IOD and PDSI cohere, I can investigate the multidecadal links between the IOD and East African PDSI, and specifically explore how PDSI and the IOD reacted to the Krakatoa eruption.
